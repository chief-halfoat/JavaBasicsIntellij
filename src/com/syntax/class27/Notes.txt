Collections Framework in Java:
    collection of classes that help us manage and manipulate data in a better way.
1) ArraysList
    a) This class has many built-in methods like add(), remove(), clear(), etc
    b) Dynamic and can adjust their size at run time

ArrayList<> arrayList = new ArrayList<>();
    ArrayList=> name of the class
    <> => diamond operator, specify the datatype
Wrapper Classes
    byte=>Byte
    short=> Short
    int=>Integer
    double=>Double
    boolean=>Boolean
    char=>Character
    long=>Long
    float=>Float

Why Wrapper Classes?
1) We get built-in methods
2) a lot of frameworks don't support primitives

When to use primitive?
    a) When we care about the memory because primitives occupy 4 times less memory as compared to wrapper
    b) Performance

When to use Wrapper?
    a) when we care about our ease
