Lists should be use when we have to store single elements as a collection
1)they maintain the insertion order
2)They allow us to store duplicate elements
3)dynamic in size
4)data is stored based on indices

2 famous classes that implement List are:
ArrayList
LinkedList

ArrayList
    when most of the operations are storing new data or reading data, not being manipulated

LinkedList
    when most of the operations are storing new data in-between or at the start of the list

Sets
    store single values
    do not allow duplicates
    there are tons of sets, but 3 important ones for us:
        HashSet
        LinkedHashSet
        TreeSet

HashSet
    most used
    fastest for insertion and retrieval
LinkedHashSet
    maintains insertion order
    insertion is slower than hash, faster than TreeSet
    retrieval is slowest
TreeSet
    sorts the data in natural order
    insertion speed is slowest
    retrieval is faster than LinkedHashSet but slower than HashSet
