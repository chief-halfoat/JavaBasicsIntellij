Inheritance in Java:

This is a mechanism in Java through which one class can acquire the properties and methods from another class.
The class from which we acquire the properties is called parent/superclass/baseclass and the classes which acquire
    the properties and methods are called child/derived class/subclass

Advantages:
    Code duplication is reduced
    (More efficient, more secure, less memory)
    Saves memory
    Execution time is less
    JVM processes code

Disadvantages
    Tight coupling of classes//If we change something in a parent class, it will affect all the child classes.
        We must ensure any changes are compatible with the code in the child classes

When should we use inheritance:
    If there is a case in which we would have to use the same methods in many classes AND the classes are closely related
        to each other

Types of inheritance:
1) Single
    One parent class and one child class
2) Hierarchical
    One parent class with multiple child classes
3) Multilevel
    One parent class and one child class, with multiple middle classes
4) Multiple
    A single child class and multiple parent classes. Not natively supported in Java, but can be achieved with interfaces

Rules:
1) Private members are not inherited (private fields and private methods)
2) Constructors do not participate in inheritance
    2a) if we have a constructor in the parent, we must have a matching constructor in child class
3) child classes can only inherit one parent class
