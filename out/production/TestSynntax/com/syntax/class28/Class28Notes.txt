ArrayList vs LinkedList

1)We can store the duplicate values in Lists
2)Insertion order is maintained

When to use ArrayList
1) if most of the operations are reading and storing new data and not shifting or changing position of the data then we should go with ArrayList

When to use LinkedList
1) When most of the operations are related to changing the position of the data or related to data shifting
