Maps in Java:
    Map is an interface that allows us to store the data in key value pairs

Benefits:
    we can store 2 values in maps
    searching is very efficient

Types of maps:
    HashMap
    LinkedHashMap
    TreeMap

HashMap:
    insertion is not maintained
    insertion and retrieval is fastest

LinkedHashMap
    insertion order is maintained
    insertion speed is same as HashMap, but retrieval speed is slowest

TreeMap
    data is sorted in natural order by default
    insertion speed is slowest, but retrieval speed is between HashMap and LinkedHashMap

Rules:
    Autocasting does not work in Maps
    Cannot convert from Collections to Maps
    Duplicate keys are not allowed
    Duplicate Values are allowed.
    Repeated keys will be overwritten
