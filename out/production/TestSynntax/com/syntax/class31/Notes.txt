Maps in Java
    Data structure that allows us to store key value pairs
    Searching is different
    We can use any types of keys, not restricted to integer-based natural indices

There are many maps, but the four for us are:
HashMap
LinkedHashMap
TreeMap
HashTable (old)

HashMap:
    fastest at inserting and retrieving data
    no insertion order is maintained
LinkedHashMap
    maintains insertion order
    insertion speed is the same as HashMap
    Retrieval is slowest
TreeMap
    data is sorted based on natural order by default
    insertion is slowest
HashTable
    older format
    only useful for multi-threading
    threadsafe data means it can handle multiple insertions and retrievals at the same time
        from multiple CPUs but because of thread safety feature, it is also very slow
        so if you are sure you will not be writing multithreaded codes, do not use it
