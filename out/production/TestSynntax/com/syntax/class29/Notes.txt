Set in Java
    Set is an interface of collections framework which is implemented by many classes, including:
    HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeHashSet

Properties of Set
    All Sets do not allow duplicates

HashSet
    doesn't maintain insertion order
    fastest of all sets
    most widely used
LinkedHashSet
    maintains insertion order
    slower than HashSet but faster than TreeSet (especially insertions)
TreeSet
    sorts the data in "natural order"
        for numbers, in increasing order
        for characters, in increasing order of ASCII value
    slowest of the Sets in insertion speed

When to use which type of Set:
    HashSet
        if we don't care about insertion order or data being sorted
    LinkedHashSet
        if we care about insertion order, but not data being sorted
    TreeSet
        if we care about data being sorted and don't care about speed
